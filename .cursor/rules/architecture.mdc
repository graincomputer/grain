## Agent and Tool Architecture

Our agent architecture separates the "brain" from the "toolbelt" to maximize development velocity and leverage specialized platforms.

- **Agent Framework (The Brain)**: All agent logic, including reasoning, memory, and orchestration, should be built using the **Mastra** framework.
- **Tool Integration (The Toolbelt)**: For integrations with third-party applications (e.g., GitHub, Slack, Gmail), we will use **Composio**. Do not build new integrations from scratch if a suitable one exists in Composio.

### Example Flow:
1.  An agent, powered by Mastra, receives a user request.
2.  The Mastra agent's reasoning loop determines a tool is needed.
3.  The agent calls the appropriate tool from the toolbelt provided by Composio.
4.  Composio handles the secure authentication (OAuth) and API communication with the external service.
5.  The result is returned to the Mastra agent to continue its task.
